# Clicker Empire

## A Clicker Game

I am planning to create a clicker game similar to Cookie Clicker with my own twist. The game will be about
empire building where you start off with nothing but a plot of empty land. Like any clicker game, every click you will 
gain something, in this case, every click will give you citizens. Every citizen generate tax revenue which you can use 
to upgrade your dominion more to gain even more citizens passively. The game will have you progress from a small tribe
to a massive empire.  

**Target Audience:**\
This game will be for people who love clicker and empire building games.

**Why am I interested in this project:**\
This project is of great interest to me because I am very passionate about game development and I have always wanted to 
create a game like this. It is the perfect opportunity for me to use the knowledge I gained from 210 to create a game I 
am passionate about.
